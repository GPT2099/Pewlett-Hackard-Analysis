# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
This analysis aims to help get ahead of the 'Silver-Tsunami" retirment wave by determining the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. 

## Results
- There are 90,398 employees set to retire making up 30% of the total work force within the company. 
- 64% of employees set to reitre hold senior positions. 
- The total number of employees eligible for the mentorship program is 1,549. 
- Only two managers are set to retire, but no current managers qualify for the mentorship program. 

## Summary 
There will need to be 90,398 roles filled in total as the 'Silver tsunami' retirement wave hits the company. Senior staff make up 45% of the mentorship eligible employees which will aid in ushering in the new generation of Pewlett Hackard upper level staff. If the entire workforce was assigned a mentor, each mentor would have roughly 194 pupils. This number drops significantly when considering not every company employee will be considered for advancement. The following tables below showcase the mentorship eligibility by title and department:

 ## Conclusion
 While replacing 30% of total employees is never ideal, there are helpful factors to consider. The biggest help will be that not every retiring employee will leave at once. This makes the 'Silver Tsunami' more like managable waves instead of one big tidal wave. As you can see from the charts above, development and production departments have ample employees eligible for mentorship. Given that many of these employees are senior staff and have had different titles over the years, perhaps they would be willing to return to previous departments with lower numbers of mentorship eligible employees such as finance. Lastly, the company can expect a large portion of its younger employees to be highly motivated for the opportunity to advance. They will put in the hard work required to ride the silver wave to better their own position within the company.
